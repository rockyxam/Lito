# Lito
# Description
This program is basedoohnaKLibrary Systuesming “Java
Programming Language”. For that we used JavaFX in this
development so that it will become easy with graphical interface
another word with Scene Builderprogram.
Besides, I also studied MySQL for storing data in Database

# OBJECT ORIENTTED EXPLANATION

entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data. I

The initialize method is called after all @FXML then it create Books instan
which will be inside ObservableList that we need to implement by
FXCollections.observableArrayList();
Then I will put all of that into TabbleView (JavaFX) to represent.
Also there was used Listener for track behavior of choicebox.
In order to use DB we:
1)Establishing a connection
2)Create a statement
3)Execute the query
